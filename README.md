- have one model with at least three properties
- models properties must use more than one data type(String, Number, Boolean, Date etc.)
- have a controller allowing for full CRUD functionality.
  - This includes the following routes
  - index route to view all instances of the resource
  - show route to view one single instance of the resource
  - post route to create an instance of the resource
  - patch route to update one instance of the resource
  - delete route to destroy one instance of the resource
- You must send the response as JSON(this will come into play later) as well as with an appropriate status code
